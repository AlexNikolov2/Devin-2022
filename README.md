# About the task

*Scooty - an app for f.ckin' scooters*

![fuck tito fc](./vanilla-plain/images/screenshot.png)

Our task was to build an app for hiring scooters, using HTML, CSS and JS, with Responsive design also being considered as a big plus.

I have managed to do almost complete website, with few small details missing. Albeit, I haven't implemented proper responsive design and I didn't use JavaScript.
